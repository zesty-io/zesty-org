# WebEngine

At the foundation of every Zesty.io instance is WebEngine, a rendering service which powers the dynamic rendering of full page HTML, stand-alone files of any datatype, automated JSON output, proxied remote files, and more. WebEngine has all the logic built in to instantly become your domains origin to power on-the-fly search engine rich content.&#x20;

The most foundational part of WebEngine is powering HTML or JSON views that are associated with the content items entered into [content models](../manager-ui/schema/content-models.md). Each content item can power a dynamic rich HTML view or automated JSON which has all the content relationships hydrated.  &#x20;

Depending on the [WebEngine mode](modes.md), when a content items route is hit `/about/` for example, either a fully rendered HTML page will be delivered, or, a fully hydrated JSON object of route's the content item.&#x20;

**Full Page Rendering - Hybrid and Traditional Modes**

Each content model created on a Zesty.io instance comes with a editable HTML view that can be customized to any design. Pages can be wrapped in snippets like `headers` and `footers`. Each view is wrapped in a body with an automated head of title, meta, og:tags, CSS links, and JavaScript references. The head can [optionally be customized](meta-tags/custom-head-overwrite.md). &#x20;

**Automated JSON - Headless Mode**

When WebEngine runs in [headless mode](modes.md#headless-mode-headless), it converts all routes associated to a content item and converts that data into fully hydrated JSON.&#x20;
