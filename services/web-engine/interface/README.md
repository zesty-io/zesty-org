# Interface

Please note that not all sections are available to each property. Depending on your options, configuration, or role you may see fewer sections. Sections that may not be available because of property specific options or configuration are noted with an asterisk\(\*\).

### Content

The Content section is also the dashboard for the Zesty.io Content Management interface. From this screen a user can view their analytics \(if analytics have been configured\), review a list of recently edited items, review recent platform updates, and access all of their pages and content sets, as well as export options for their blueprint.

### Media

The Media section is where all of an instance's media is housed. Users can upload a variety of media file types including JPG, PNG, SVG, as well as Mp4, MOV, and PDF and much more. Media can be easily organized by creating groups. Once images are grouped, groups can be nested and files can be moved between groups. Files and groups can be moved by dragging and dropping them.

### Editor\*

The Editor section is where all the coding happens. HTML views, Less, SCSS, and/or CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files are all located and editable here. Additionally users have access to a Parsley Code Bank, publish history, Media, Fonts, and access to the `<head>` for Meta tags, Favicon, and Doctype.

### Leads\*

The Leads section will be visible if the instance has a form that uses Zesty.io's `zcf` \(Zesty.io Contact Form\) and `zlf`\(Zesty.io Leads Form\) inputs. As forms are submitted the leads are viewable under the Leads section. Users are also able to export a CSV of leads by either a specific or custom date range.

### Analytics\*

The Analytics section shows an instance's visitor overview, top referrers, social referrers, and more from Google Analytics. In order to view analytics it must first be configured under the Schema section.

### Health

The Health section allows users to manage redirects, create a Robots.txt, and run Zesty.io's site crawler tool to review \(and fix if necessary\) Broken links, Irregular links, and Confirmed links.

### Schema

The Schema section will allow users to add content sets and pages, and to add fields to those items. Options for pages and content sets can be configured here.

### Audit Trail™\*

The Audit Trail™ section shows a list of all the changes that have been made to the property by user, and includes a time stamp. Events are also color coded depending on what action a user took.These articles will help you navigate the Zesty.io Content Manager interface with guides for content entry to accessing meta tags in the editor dive in and start building your instance with us.
