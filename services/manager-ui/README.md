# Manager UI

Please note that not all sections are available to each property. Depending on your options, configuration, or role you may see fewer sections. Sections that may not be available because of property specific options or configuration are noted with an asterisk(\*).

### Content

The Content section is also the dashboard for the Zesty.io Content Management interface. From this screen a user can view their analytics (if analytics have been configured), review a list of recently edited items, review recent platform updates, and access all of their pages and content sets, as well as export options for their blueprint.

### Media

The Media section is where all of an instance's media is housed. Users can upload a variety of media file types including JPG, PNG, SVG, as well as Mp4, MOV, and PDF and much more. Media can be easily organized by creating groups. Once images are grouped, groups can be nested and files can be moved between groups. Files and groups can be moved by dragging and dropping them.

### Code

The Code section is where all the coding happens. HTML views, Less, SCSS, and/or CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files are all located and editable here. Additionally users have access to a Parsley Code Bank, publish history, Media, Fonts, and access to the `<head>` for Meta tags, Favicon, and Doctype.

### Leads

The Leads section will be visible if the instance has a form that uses Zesty.io's `zcf` (Zesty.io Contact Form) and `zlf`(Zesty.io Leads Form) inputs. As forms are submitted the leads are viewable under the Leads section. Users are also able to export a CSV of leads by either a specific or custom date range.

### Reports

The Reports section shows an instance's requests overview, top files and media assets requested. This is also where a user can view an Audit Log of all actions performed on an instance.

### Redirects

The Redirects section allows users to manage redirects. Whether they be internal, external, or wildcard redirects.

### Schema

The Schema section will allow users to configure content models and to add fields to those models.
