It’s a groundbreaking approach to content creation, freeing up time for marketers and content creators to focus on other aspects of their digital strategy.

## How to Generate Long Form Content in Zesty?&#x20;

Writing long form content traditionally by yourself can be especially time consuming. You need to do extensive research, tackle writer's block, and then go through multiple rounds of drafts. This usually ends up with an article taking at least 5 hours to create. With our AI Content Assistant, those 5 hours are cut down to just 20 minutes.&#x20;

Simply provide a prompt or topic for your article to our AI assistant. It could be a question, a statement, or an idea related to a topic. Once the context is provided, our AI Content Assistant, with ChatGPT3 under the hood will generate a full length article based on the prompt. You can then simply review the generated content, and make appropriate edits and additions as necessary, and you’re then ready to hit publish!
