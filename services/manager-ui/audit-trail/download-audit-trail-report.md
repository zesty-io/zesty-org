# Download Audit Trail Report

Your legal team may need to use log data as evidence for legal purposes. In these situations, they may request a PDF file of all actions taken on a resource/s which they can register with a court of law. Below are the steps to download such a PDF report.

## Step 1: Click on Reports in the left navigation bar

The Activity Log should open by default to the "Resources" tab.

## Step 2: Click on a resource in the "Resources" tab of Activity Log

For example, I am clicking on "Microsoft Active Directory integration [Zesty.io](http://zesty.io/)".
