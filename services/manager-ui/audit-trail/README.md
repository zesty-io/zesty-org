## What is Activity Log?

Activity Log (previously Audit Trail) is a feature in Reports that allows you to review and gain insights about your instance's activity and see a timeline of user actions for a specific resource such as a content item, a model, a code file/snippet, or a setting. It is extremely useful in allowing you to conduct security audits to catch malicious user actions and in helping you prioritize what your team should be working on.

**You can use Activity Log to:**

1. [View Activity of a Resource such as a Content Item or a Model or a Code File](view-activity-of-a-resource.md)
2. [View Activity of a Specific User](view-activity-of-a-user.md)
3. [Download an Audit Trail Report of a Selected Resource for legal purposes](download-audit-trail-report.md)
4. [View an Overview Timeline of Actions on Your Instance](view-instance-timeline.md)
5. [View Insights About Your Instance Activity](view-instance-activity-insights.md)
