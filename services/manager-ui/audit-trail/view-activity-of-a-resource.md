# View Activity of a Resource

Sometimes, you may want to only view activity for a single resource such as a content item, model, code file, or setting. For example, you may want to know who scheduled a content item to be published or who most recently modified a code file.**There are four ways you can do this:**

1. By selecting a resource from the Resources Tab in Activity Log
2. By selecting the "View Logs" option in the:
   1. Draft history card of an item in "Content"
   2. Model info card of a model in "Schema"
   3. Activity Log card in the bottom panel of a code file in "Code"

Below are step-by-step instructions for the methods mentioned above.

## Method 1: From Activity Log

### Step 1: Click on Reports in the left navigation bar

The Activity Log should open by default to the "Resources" tab.
