# Tabs

## What are Tabs?

Sometimes when working on a project, you may want to quickly switch back and forth between different apps or resources. For example you may want to continuously switch between a content resource, a media item, and a code resource as you complete a project.&#x20;

With the Zesty Tabs experience you can achieve this by pinning multiple apps and resources as tabs so that they are permanently present and accessible in the top navigation bar.&#x20;

## FAQ&#x20;

### How do I pin a Tab?&#x20;

1. Go to the current tab and click on the pin icon in the right part of the tab.&#x20;
2. It will then become pinned.

### How do I open a Tab?&#x20;

New tabs automatically open as you switch between different resources and apps of your instance. However they only permanently remain if you pin them. If you do not pin a tab, it automatically closes once you switch to a new resource/app. See the GIF below for reference.&#x20;

### How do I close a Tab?&#x20;

#### **If your tab is not pinned (pin only has an outline):** &#x20;

Simply switch to a different tab. You will automatically close your existing tab.&#x20;

#### **If your tab is pinned (pin has a grey fill):**

* First unpin the tab by clicking on the pin icon.
* Then switch to a different resource or tab.

### What is the More Menu?&#x20;

Sometimes you may happen to pin many tabs (for example let's assume 10 tabs). In such a scenario, all tabs cannot easily fit in the space available. Hence we shift the earliest pinned tabs to a "More menu" which you can find at the end of all the pinned tabs.&#x20;

**From this menu you can:**&#x20;

* Go to pinned tabs
* Unpin pinned tabs
* Search pinned tabs (when there are one too many pinned)
