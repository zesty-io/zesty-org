  Zesty.io's Fields Content Models create content entry fields for a content set
  and a view (page). Multiple field datatypes can be added to any content set or
  page
---

# Fields

### Overview

Zesty.io has approximately 20 field datatype options. Each option is named and describe below. As you go through adding fields to your Content Models, you'll give each field a label and reference name. The label is what you'll see in the Content section as you're making your entries. The reference is what you'll use to call that field using Parsley for templating your views, snippets, and/or feeds in the Editor section.&#x20;
