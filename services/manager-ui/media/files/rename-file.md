# Rename File

## Step 1: Go to the Media App

In the left navigation bar, click on the media tab. By default it should open to the all Media Tab of your instance. If you wish to preview files in a specific folder, then please also select the folder you wish to upload.

## Step 5: Type in your new file name and click done

**Note:**&#x20;

* This will change the URL path and could break existing links referenced in production after a period of time
* In Zesty, we only allow you to change the file name and not the file extension so as to prevent unintentional errors or mistakes.
