# Files

In Zesty, you can upload a variety of files such as PNGs, JPEGs, SVG, PDF, MOV, Mp4, GIF, PDFs, and more. Once you upload a file to Media anyone in the instance can preview it, get important information (such as the name, ZUID, URL), make quick edits using our "On-The-Fly" editor, and use it in content. The below pages in this section document how you can do the same.&#x20;
