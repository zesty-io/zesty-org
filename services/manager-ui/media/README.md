## What is Media?

Media (also known as a Digital Asset Manager), is a feature through which you can upload, store, share, and organize files such as images, videos, PDFs, etc. You can then access and use these files in content on your website or app to create richer content experiences.**The key benefits of using the Media app are:**

1. **Single Source of Truth for Files:** All your files can be uploaded, searched, managed, and viewed from one place.
2. **Multiple Image Output Formats:** While we always store image assets in their original state, we have an "On-the-fly" image editor to access a myriad of output formats and optimizations, and alterations you can choose to best fit your use case.
