# Create Folders

## Step 1: Click on Media in the Left Navigation Bar

By default it should open to "All Media". From here you can view all the files you have uploaded in your instance such as images, documents, and videos.

## Step 3: In the pop-up, select your destination folder, type your new folder name, and click done

**If you want this folder to be:**

* At the root level of your instance bin, then select the destination folder as "None".
* Inside of an existing folder, then select the destination folder as whichever folder you want it to be inside of
