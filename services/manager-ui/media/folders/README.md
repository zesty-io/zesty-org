# Folders

## What are Folders?

To organize your files in Media, you can create folders to make files easier to find. These folders can also have sub-folders for more organization. In this section, we will go over how to:

* [Create Folders](create-folders.md)
* [Create Sub Folders](create-sub-folders.md)
* [Find and View Folders](find-and-view-folders.md)
* [Rename Folders](rename-folders.md)
* [Hide Folders](hide-folders.md)

_Note: These folders are only visual representations used in the interface and do not affect the path of the media._
