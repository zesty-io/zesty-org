# Folders

## What are Folders?

To organize your files in Media, you can create folders to make files easier to find. These folders can also have sub-folders for more organization. In this section, we will go over how to:

* Create Folders
* Create Sub-Folders
* View Folders
* Rename Folders
* Hide Folders

_Note: These folders are only visual representations used in the interface and do not affect the path of the media._
