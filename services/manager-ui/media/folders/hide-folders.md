# Hide Folders

Hiding folders can further help a user navigate groups, especially with a large number of assets. Below are the steps to hide a folder.&#x20;

## Step 1: Click on Media in the Left Navigation Bar

By default it should open to "All Media". From here you can view all the files you have uploaded in your instance such as images, documents, and videos.

## Step 2: Click on the folder you wish to hide in the left Media sidebar

You can also alternatively navigate to a folder via the search experience in Media.

## Step 3: In the Folder Header, click on the arrow next to the folder name

This should trigger a drop down menu.&#x20;

## Step 4: Select the Hide Folder in the Dropdown Menu

## Step 5: Now your folder is hidden.&#x20;

You will see it has now moved from the folders section in the sidebar to the hidden folders section at the bottom of the sidebar. You can view this section by expanding it.&#x20;
