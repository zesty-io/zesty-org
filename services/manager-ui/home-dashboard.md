## What is Home?&#x20;

Home in Zesty is the best way to get a high level view of everything happening in your instance. &#x20;

**From here you can:**&#x20;

* View key performance metrics which enable you to monitor the health of your instance
* Open recently worked on content items, code files, and models
* Create new content items, code files, and models and upload new media files
* Jump to resources such as our product docs, release notes, and community channels

## How to get started with Home?&#x20;

We recommend you get started by learning more about the home interface.&#x20;

### View the High Level Metrics for your instance

Here you can view key performance metrics such as the total web requests, media requests, items scheduled, and items published and see how they have changed for the last 30 days. These will help you make more informed business decisions and also help ensure you keep your team aligned with your business goals.&#x20;
