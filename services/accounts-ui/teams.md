# Teams

## Overview

Teams allow users to create a team of users and set a single [role](https://zesty.org/getting-started/roles-and-permissions) for each team. This helps streamline the management of users, especially when dealing with large teams and multiple instances.

{% hint style="info" %}
Teams are created in the Teams interface and a team's role is managed in the [instance's settings drawer](https://zesty.org/glossary#instance-settings-drawer).   
  
To **accept an invite** to a team, navigate to the Teams interface and accept your invitation.
