# Teams

### Overview

Teams allow users to create a team of users and set a single [role](https://zesty.org/content-instance/roles-and-permissions) for each team. This helps streamline the management of users, especially when dealing with large teams and multiple instances. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Teams are created in the Teams interface and a team's role is managed in the [instance's settings drawer](https://zesty.org/glossary#instance-settings-drawer).
{% endhint %}

#### Creating a New Team

Create a new Team by filling out the Team Name and Description fields, and then clicking the green button on the first card in the grid.
