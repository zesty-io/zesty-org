### How to Turn on GQL

For any Zesty.io Content Instance you may turn on the GQL setting in the content manager &gt; settings &gt; developer. The settings are named \[developer\]\[gql\] and \[developer\]\[gql\_origin\], if these setting are missing from your instance, reach out to the support slack to have them added.
