  The Account Manager houses all of your instances. Your instances are your
  unique projects created in the Zesty.io platform. Creating a new Instance is
  the first step in building out your content.

# Create a New Instance

### 1. Create the Instance

From the Account Manager, select the green  "**+ CREATE INSTANCE**" button. You will be prompted to name your new project.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Instances can be networked through an [EcoSystem](../services/ecosystems.md#zesty-io-ecosystems). If you do not have an EcoSystem, leaving this selection as -None- is sufficient.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Choose a Blueprint

You will be given the option to select a pre built **blueprint** or "Blank Slate."

* **Blank Slate:** provides a Zesty instance with no inherent CSS styling
* **Styled Blueprints:** these blueprints provide a Zesty instance that has prebuilt styling characteristics based on a CSS framework. (i.e.: Bootstrap). The previews provide a look into the prebuilt styling.
