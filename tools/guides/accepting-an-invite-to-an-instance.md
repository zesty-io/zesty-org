# Accepting an Invite to an Instance

### Overview

Only users of an instance can access it and edit its content. To become a user of an instance a user needs to be its [owner](https://zesty.org/getting-started/roles-and-permissions#owner), part of [team](https://zesty.org/guides/adding-a-team) that's assigned to it, or invited to access it. After a user is invited to access an instance they'll need to accept their invite before they can access the instance. Likewise, if a user is not the owner or a team member of an instance they'll need be invited _and_ accept that invite to an instance before they can access it. 

There are 2 ways to login to accept your invite: via email and by navigating to [https://accounts.zesty.io/login](https://accounts.zesty.io/login). 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even though a user does _not_ have a Zesty.io account they can still be invited to access an instance. However, they will need to create an account _before_ they can accept their invite.
{% endhint %}

### Before you begin

If you've never created an account in Zesty.io then [create an account](https://accounts.zesty.io/signup).

1. Navigate to [https://accounts.zesty.io/signup](https://accounts.zesty.io/signup) to sign up for an account.

If you don't see a verification email in your inbox check your spam folder.

3. Click the orange "Verify your email address" button to verify your email address.

### Troubleshooting

#### Email Mismatch

If you've been invited to access an instance but you do not see an invitation once you login, ensure that the invite email and Zesty.io account email _are an exact match_. For example, you'll have issues accessing your invitation if your account has been created with a personal email address, and the invitation was sent to a professional email address.

**Invitee doesn't have a Zesty.io account**

Anyone can be invited to access an instance whether or not they have an existing Zesty.io account. However, only users who **do have an existing account** will be able to accept an invite. Before you try to accept an invite be sure that you have a Zesty.io account under the email that you've been invited with.

**Unable to accept invite via email link**

If you're unable to accept an invite via the link in the email you can login to your account and view invitations in the Accounts interface and accept them there. Invitations to instances show up in their own section above the instances that you already have access to.
