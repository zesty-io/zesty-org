# Adding Image Alt Text

### Overview

Adding alt text to images makes sites more accessible for users who are unable to see them.&#x20;

### Implementation

There are several ways that alt text can be implemented in Zesty.io. We recommend using the [Media section](https://zesty.org/services/manager-ui/media)'s Title field, or a text [field](https://zesty.org/services/manager-ui/schema/fields) in the [Content section](https://zesty.org/services/manager-ui/content) to make the alt description easily accessible to and editable by the content owner.&#x20;

Alt text can also be hardcoded in via the [Web IDE](https://zesty.org/services/manager-ui/editor), however this approach will not give your content owners the flexibility to edit that text as necessary.&#x20;

The steps below will cover how to use the Media sections Title field or a text field in the Content section to add alt text. &#x20;

### Steps: Media Section Title Field

1\. Navigate to the Media section.
