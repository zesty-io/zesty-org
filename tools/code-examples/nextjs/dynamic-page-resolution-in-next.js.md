# Dynamic Page Resolution in Next.js

To dynamically load your Zesty.io instance's content into your Next.js project, you will need three files and zesty env values in your next.config.js file. You can see a working example of this in our nextjs starter [https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter](https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter). The starter is a great place to launch your nextjs app with everything for Zesty.io already configured.

If you plan to integrate Zesty.io into your project, this document will break down how the integration works in the [https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter](https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter) starter project.

### Files Needed

1. ``[`[...slug].js`](https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter/blob/main/pages/\[...slug].js) in the root of your `pages/` directory.
2. ``[`fetchPage.js`](https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter/blob/main/lib/zesty/fetchPage.js) a function that resolves dynamic content into `[...slug].js`
3. ``[`ZestyView`](https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter/blob/main/components/zesty/ZestyView.js) a dynamic component that resolves `views/zesty/` content model components

### ENV Setup - next.config.js&#x20;

example [https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter/blob/main/next.config.js](https://github.com/zesty-io/nextjs-starter/blob/main/next.config.js)

```
// Some code
const { fetchZestyRedirects } = require('./lib/zesty/fetchRedirects');

// generated by lib/sync.js
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true,
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true
  },
  async redirects() {
    return await fetchZestyRedirects()
  },
  env: {
      zesty: {
          instance_zuid: "", // zesty unique id of content instance
          stage: "", // e.g. the preview url from zesty https://XYZ-dev.webengine.zesty.io
          production: "", // e.g. the live url https://www.acme.com
          stage_password: "",
          src_dir: "", // where the next project has pages, components, etc folders
          options: {
            skip_config_overwrite: false, // for setups with custom config files, after initial setup of the env.zesty object, set to true
            model_ignore_list: [
              '6-xyz-xyz',
              '6-xyz-xyz' // an array of models ZUIDS to ignore when creating component files in views/zesty
            ]
          }

      }
  }
}
```

### Working with Zesty View Components

After a `npm run sync` a view component is created for each Zesty Content Model in the `views/zesty` directory. Zesty Content Items that have URL will automatically resolve to the component in that `views` directory that is assocaited with the content models name.

Each Component loads with a {content} object, this object is a direct feed of that URLs ?toJSON response. [Read about toJSON](https://zesty.org/services/web-engine/introduction-to-parsley/parsley-index#tojson)
