# Roles & Permissions

User Roles and Permissions are applied to User or [Team access](https://zesty.org/guides/adding-a-team) to via the Accounts [instance settings drawer](https://zesty.org/services/accounts-ui/instance-settings-drawer). Role permissions range from limiting the types of resources a user can access to whether they can save, create, delete or publish.

All users are managed by Owner and Admin user roles. Access and roles are specific to an individual user's role on a single instance. If they are a member of a team then their access will be limited to the team's role as its assigned on an instance.

All roles have access to publishing/unpublishing and deleting content _except for the Contributor role_.&#x20;
